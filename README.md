## Issues to think about

So far examineing just 2010-2015 as this is last full 5 year cycle. Does it make sense to build an elecion model for this single election 
cycle and then add in more data? Other election cycles are coded differently, so will need different import/cleaning function and to merge
the datasets they will need to be in a consistient format.
